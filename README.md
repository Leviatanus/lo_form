## About

LoForm is a low-code and lightweight Flutter form library,
inspired by [**Formik**](https://formik.org/), yet the implementation is very different due to the nature of TypeScript vs Dart. LoForm tries to focus on simplicity and to solve most of the drawbacks and limitations of other existing solutions.
