## About

LoForm is a low-code and lightweight Flutter form library,
inspired by [**Formik**](https://formik.org/), yet the implementation is very different due to the nature of TypeScript vs Dart. 
LoForm tries to focus on simplicity and to solve most of the drawbacks and limitations of other existing solutions.

## Motivation

 1. Eliminate the need to manage form state using state management libraries, because it requires a lot of boilerplate, which makes it prune to errors and hard to maintain.
 1. Handle API errors implicitly, unlike existing solutions like [flutter_form_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder) which requires external errors to be managed by a separate state.
 1. Use a widget-driven approach for simplicity, unlike existing solutions [reactive_forms](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_forms) which takes a model-driven approach.
 1. Manage form state without using code generation, because forms themselves are hideous, so imagine adding up code generation headache, yikes.
