# Why Not ...?

## [FormState](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FormState-class.html)

- Requires controllers or state to track fields' values _(i.e. You need to create `TextEditingController` to get `TextField` value)_.
- Requires a separate state to assign API errors require to fields.
- Requires extra state to track form's status (Loading, Invalid, etc.).

## [Flutter Form Builder](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder)

- Requires a separate state to assign API errors require to fields.
- Requires a key to be able to access form.
- Requires explicit calls for `save` and `validate`.

## [Reactive Forms](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_forms)

- Requires a lot of boilerplate (due to the model-driven approach).
- Complex and has a higher learning curve.

## [BLoC](https://bloclibrary.dev/) + [Formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz)

- Requires a lot of boilerplate, really a lot!
- Complex and has a higher learning curve.
- Formz doesn't get any more updates.
