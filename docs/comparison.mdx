# LoForm vs [FormState](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FormState-class.html)

Cons of FormState:

- Requires controllers or state to track fields' values _(i.e. You need to create `TextEditingController` to get `TextField` value)_.
- Requires a separate state to assign API errors require to fields.
- Requires extra state to track form's status (Loading, Invalid, etc.).

# LoForm vs [Flutter Form Builder](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder)

Cons of Flutter Form Builder:

- Requires a separate state to assign API errors require to fields.
- Requires a key to be able to access form.
- Requires explicit calls for `save` and `validate`.
